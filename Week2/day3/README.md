# Task Manager 

This is my Week 2 React task.  
In this project, I built a simple task manager using React and Material UI.  

## What I Did
- First I created a new React app for Day 3.  
- I added components for TaskForm and TaskCard.  
- Then I implemented features to add tasks, complete or delete them.  
- After that, I improved the UI using Material UI components.  
- I added categories for tasks, a progress bar to track completion, and sorting options.  
- Finally, I tested the app and pushed it to my GitHub repository.  

## Features
- Add tasks with category selection  
- Mark tasks as complete or undo them  
- Delete tasks  
- View progress bar of total vs completed tasks  
- Sort tasks by newest, oldest, completed, or pending
